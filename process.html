                        The AI behind Bully Block is like a smart reader that carefully watches how students communicate online through Canvas. Here's how it works:<br>
                        <br><strong>It Cleans Up What Students Write:</strong><br>
                        First, it reads the messages and cleans them up — taking out unnecessary symbols, lowercasing everything, and simplifying words so they're easier to understand.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Understands The Message:</strong><br>
                        The system looks at the grammar, what kind of words are used (like emotions or names), and what the message is really saying — kind of like how a teacher can tell if a student is joking or being mean.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Decides How Serious The Message Is:</strong><br>
                        Based on tone and certain keywords, the AI gives the message a score — zero, low, or high — depending on whether it seems kind, neutral, or harmful.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Trains Itself To Get Better:</strong><br>
                        The AI uses examples of past messages to learn. Some are obvious bullying, others are not. Over time, the AI learns patterns — kind of like how we learn from practice.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Uses Multiple Brains:</strong><br>
                        We built different types of AI "brains" — some are fast and basic, others are deep thinkers. Then we compare how they each perform and keep improving them.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Visualizes Its Learning:</strong><br>
                        The system shows charts and graphs that help us understand how well it's learning and if it's making mistakes — just like report cards!<br>

                        The Bully Block system uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect and classify instances of cyberbullying in real-time. 
                        Below is a detailed breakdown of the AI pipeline, including the purpose of each tool and how they are applied in our workflow.<br>
                        <br>

                        <summary><strong>Step 1: Text Preprocessing</strong></summary>
                        <div class="component-details">
                            To ensure messages are analyzed accurately, the system first refines raw text using a preprocessing pipeline powered by NLTK and spaCy.<br>
                            <strong>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)</strong> is a Python library widely used for working with human language data. In our system, it handles:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Tokenization – breaking up sentences into individual words or tokens</li>
                                <li>Stop word removal – filtering out common words like "the", "is", "on", which don't add meaningful value for classification</li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong>spaCy</strong> is a modern NLP library optimized for performance and accuracy. It performs:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Lemmatization – simplifying words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"), which helps models generalize better</li>
                            </ul>
                            <strong>Regex (Regular Expressions)</strong> is used to:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Strip out punctuation, numbers, and special characters that may skew sentiment and feature calculations</li>
                            </ul>
                            Normalization includes lowercasing all text to ensure consistent pattern matching.<br>
                            The goal of this phase is to produce clean, uniform text that’s ready for feature analysis and model training.<br>

                        <summary><strong>Step 2: Feature Extraction</strong></summary>
                        <div class="component-details">
                            Once the text is cleaned, the system extracts meaningful features to help the AI understand both what is being said and how it's being said.<br>
                            <strong>Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:</strong> Using spaCy, each word is labeled with its grammatical role (noun, verb, adjective, etc.), helping the model interpret context.<br> 
                            <strong>Named Entity Recognition (NER):</strong> Extracts key names, locations, and dates. This helps in identifying messages that reference real people or events, which may elevate the severity.<br>
                            <strong>TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency):</strong> A mathematical method that turns text into numeric vectors based on how important a word is in a document relative to all documents. 
                            This representation is essential for training ML and DL models.<br>
                            <br>Sentiment Analysis:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner)</strong>, part of NLTK, assigns a compound sentiment score (ranging from -1 to +1) to each message.</li>
                                <li>Token-level scoring evaluates individual words.</li>
                                <li>We also compute a sentiment balance metric: positive_score minus negative_score, which becomes an input to the classifier.</li>
                            </ul>

                            To create a fast and lightweight baseline model, we use scikit-learn, a widely-used Python machine learning library.<br>
                            <strong>Logistic Regression:</strong> A statistical model that predicts binary or multi-class outcomes — in our case, zero, low, or high severity.<br>
                            <strong>Support Vector Machines (SVM):</strong> Classifies text using hyperplanes and margins, often effective for small to medium-sized datasets.<br>
                            <br>Model tuning and validation:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>We use cross-validation to ensure the model works well across different slices of the data.</li>

                            As cyberbullying messages can involve complex context and sequencing, deep learning allows the system to recognize patterns beyond surface-level word frequency.<br>

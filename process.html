                        The AI behind Bully Block is like a smart reader that carefully watches how students communicate online through Canvas. Here's how it works:<br>
                        <br><strong>It Cleans Up What Students Write:</strong><br>
                        First, it reads the messages and cleans them up — taking out unnecessary symbols, lowercasing everything, and simplifying words so they’re easier to understand.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Understands The Message:</strong><br>
                        The system looks at the grammar, what kind of words are used (like emotions or names), and what the message is really saying — kind of like how a teacher can tell if a student is joking or being mean.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Decides How Serious The Message Is:</strong><br>
                        Based on tone and certain keywords, the AI gives the message a score — low, medium, or high — depending on whether it seems kind, neutral, or harmful.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Trains Itself To Get Better:</strong><br>
                        The AI uses examples of past messages to learn. Some are obvious bullying, others are not. Over time, the AI learns patterns — kind of like how we learn from practice.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Uses Multiple Brains:</strong><br>
                        We built different types of AI "brains" — some are fast and basic, others are deep thinkers. Then we compare how they each perform and keep improving them.<br>
                        <br><strong>It Visualizes Its Learning:</strong><br>
                        The system shows charts and graphs that help us understand how well it’s learning and if it’s making mistakes — just like report cards!<br>

                    <div class="component-details">
                        The Bully Block system uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to detect and classify instances of cyberbullying in real-time. 
                        Below is a detailed breakdown of the AI pipeline, including the purpose of each tool and how they are applied in our workflow.<br>
                        <br><strong>Step 1: Text Preprocessing</strong><br>
                        To ensure messages are analyzed accurately, the system first refines raw text using a preprocessing pipeline powered by NLTK and spaCy.<br>
                        <strong>NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)</strong> is a Python library widely used for working with human language data. In our system, it handles:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Tokenization – breaking up sentences into individual words or tokens</li>
                            <li>Stop word removal – filtering out common words like "the", "is", "on", which don't add meaningful value for classification</li>
                        </ul>
                        <br><strong>spaCy</strong> is a modern NLP library optimized for performance and accuracy. It performs:<br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Lemmatization – simplifying words to their base or dictionary form (e.g., "running" becomes "run"), which helps models generalize better</li>
                        </ul>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </details>
            </ul>

            <h3>BullyBlock Incident Reports</h3>
            <div class="component-details">
                On the Incidents page, users can access a comprehensive table of all reported incidents. Reports can be filtered by 
                "Resolved" and "Pending Review" statuses. Each entry in the table includes:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Content ID, User ID, and Username</strong> of the student involved</li>
                    <li><strong>Severity Level</strong> categorized as <em>Low, Medium, or High</em></li>
                    <li><strong>Alert Status</strong>, indicating whether the incident has been addressed by school personnel</li>
                    <li><strong>Timestamp</strong>, displaying the exact date and time of the incident</li>
                </ul>
                To view the full details of an incident, users can simply click on the corresponding entry in the table.

            <h3>Bullying Analytics</h3>
            <div class="component-details">
                The Analytics page provides users with detailed insights into bullying incidents and visualizations of the 
                BullyBlock AI's performance. It includes:
                <ul>
                    <li>A ranked list of students based on the frequency of reported incidents</li>
                    <li>An overview of bullying prevalence categorized by severity level</li>
                    <li>A table highlighting key dates with the highest number of cyberbullying occurrences</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Notifications</h3>
            <div class="component-details">
                Notifications alert users to new cyberbullying incidents and status changes of previous cyberbullying incidents.
